    <h1>How to Use this Project:</h1>
    
    <br>
        <h2>Step 1) Make sure to have Processing 3 installed.</h2>
        <p>Install processing 3 <a href = "https://processing.org/download" target="_blank">here</a>. 
            Make sure to install Processing 3, as this project is designed to run in Processing 3, and might not work in Processing 4.
            After downloading the compressed folder, unzip the folder into downloads, and run the .exe file which appears in the folder.</p>
        <h2>Step 2) Download the Project folder.</h2>
        <p>Download the project <a href = "breakout.zip" target="_blank">here</a>. Extract the folder to anywhere you want.</p>
        <h2>Step 3) Run the project.</h3>
        <p>Open the breakout.pde file, and press the "Run" button at the top left corner of the window. Next, type the address given in the program
            into a new tab (127.0.0.1:10002). Finally, simply press the "Start" button.
        </p>
        <h2>How do you actually use the program?</h2>
        <p>The "Start" button starts and resumes the program, the "Pause" button pauses the program, and the "Reset" button resets the program. The
            "Gradient" checkbox toggles on or off the gradient background. The "Send all" button at the top can be ignored. The boxes containing 
            "Lives", "Level", and "Bricks left" are monitors, which tell you the number of lives you have, the level you're on, and the number of 
            bricks left on screen, respectively. "Ball color" present you with a menu to change the controllable ball's color, and the "Difficulty"
            slider changes the speed at which the ball travels at. The "code" box allows you to input a cheat code, if you know any (hint: one of them is "livesXD").
