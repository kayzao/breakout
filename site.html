        <p>(prob wanna insert a yt video showing it in action just saying)hi</p>
        <p>We used various built in functions in processing 3 to create the game breakout. Many of these functions can be found in the reference section
        which is located on the help bar above your text. Examples of built in functions/methods are as follows: if, else, length, for, float, boolean, int, and much more!
        BRC is an external source created by our very own Mr. Brooks, what this allows us to do is to implement a variety of different UI elements to enhance your experience!
        Examples of additions are as follows: buttons, sliders, monitors, checkboxes, text-input boxes, and more! Many of the utilities listed were incorporated into the code
        you see before you.</p>
